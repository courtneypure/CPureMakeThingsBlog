This is my first post on my GatsbyJS generated site! But probably my second / third attempt to start one.

The first time I did it was after I took a webinar with [Tae'lur Alexis](https://twitter.com/TaelurAlexis)!  It was pretty late at night and instead of letting the information sink in I dived head first into trying to set up my blog.  Well needless to say that did not go well.  The more frustrated I got with the errors popping up, the more I thought I was helping the situation the worse it got.  

Sometimes it's good to just stop and come back another day.  Also this is a completely new tool for me.  So I came back with a fresh  mind after riding the 6 miles to the coffee shop and I sat down and Google searched 'How To Start a Gatbsy.js Blog' and I ran across Dave Ceddia's post ['Start at blog in 2019 with Gatsby.js and Netlify.'](https://daveceddia.com/start-blog-gatsby-netlify/)

This time with a clearer mind and a nice cup of tea I sat down and went line by line.  Programming is really about following directions! Who would have thought?!
