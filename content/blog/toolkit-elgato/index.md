description: My latest productivity hack using the Stream Deck.
---

Over the past few years, I have been refining my workspace to a relatively minimal setup. I have a 2020 Macbook Pro which is connected to a Wacom 13HD cintiq, a Nuphy wireless keyboard, and a magic mouse. Due to the limiting ports on the Macbook Pro, the cintiq needs to be connected to a Caldigit dock to work so I generally don’t travel with that. I will just take the computer, keyboard, and mouse. This was purposefully designed with the ease of traveling in mind.

Having made the switch from traditional hand drawn animation to motion graphics has made creating a travel-friendly workspace a lot easier. I do 98% of my work in After Effects and although now I only need a computer and a mouse, my biggest gripe with the program is the infinite twirl down menus. Searching through options wastes a lot of time so I learned as many hotkeys to set keyframes, move layers, and more. I would have my wireless keyboard on the left side of my screen and a mouse on the other but that became pretty cumbersome and awkward. My desk is pretty small - it’s 39.5 inches (cm) and has a light box inset into part of it. If I have to type out a note or an email I have to either move the keyboard back to the center or awkwardly contort my body to the left. Not very ergonomic.

I needed to find another solution and thus began my journey into the world of macropads!

My first requirement with adding any new item to my workspace is avoiding clutter.  My initial idea was to get a macropad from small company called [Pikatea](https://www.pikatea.com/). I loved how simple and clean their pads looked and figured I could easily attach this to my cintiq. After giving it further thought, five buttons wasn’t going to be enough for the extensive list of hotkeys I use on the regular. I think it would be great for video calls - they have cool knob designs for volume controls but this was not going to fit my AE workflow.  After further research I [stumbled upon this video about how this guy used a stream deck for his WFH setup.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrWRzYYC1rE) He used it for a variety of tasks including launching programs, creating Notion templates, managing emails, and even controlling his lighting.

Unlike the other macropads I felt the Stream Deck would give me more versatility with a little less programming. Not only could I program my hotkeys but I could used this for Twitch, Youtube, even twitter if I wanted to do live stream content later on. Plus after watching the video I saw I could take this even further by setting up an [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

The stream deck is VERY easy to set up. It’s basically plug and play. You download the software and you create a profile.  In this case I named mine AE.  I also have one for Photoshop and Illustrator.  Then I scrolled down to the ‘System’ folder and dragged the ‘Hotkey’ option to one of the squares. From there you can rename it, assign the keystrokes and customize and arrange the buttons as you see fit. That’s it.

Here is the layout of my AE profile.

Starting with the top row I of course have a Save button option. I do have auto-save set on AE but don’t rely on it all the time. I have a save current frame, pre-compose, and copy, pasta preset which are all pretty self explanatory.

Row two is probably my favorite and has been a big solve for the twirl down hinderance. I have set keyframe options for position, scale, rotation and opacity. This is my favorite since I just scroll the time line and just hit a button to add a keyframe to that property!

Then I have  

This may not be for everyone but if you like to keep your setup simple and not have to travel with a ton of tools I would say this is a perfect option.  I like the versatility of being able to use it across different programs, have different profiles, and use it for video calls or live streaming. This made it the perfect fit for my travel friendly workspace setup!
